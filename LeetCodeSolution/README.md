This is my second project on Web Development of my coding journey under GDSC-IITI Induction Task.
I would like to thank GDSC-IITI for introducing this induction task, so that I got a chance to learn basics of React which will 
significantly contribute in my Web Dev journey.

In this project, we were supposed to built a website which will let the users see the solution of different LeetCode Challenges
in mainly three languages viz C++, Java and Python. We were provided with the reference of haoel/leetcode repository, which
is a public repository containing solutions to many leetcode problems. 

This project comprises of following functionality :
